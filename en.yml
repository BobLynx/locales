        ### üìú InterChat Network Rules

        1. **Use Common Sense:** Be considerate of others and their views. No slurs, extreme derogatory language or any actions that can disrupt the chat's comfort.
        2. **No Spamming or Flooding:** Avoid repeated, nonsensical, or overly lengthy messages.
        3. **Keep Private Matters Private:** Avoid sharing personal information across the network.
        4. **No Harassment:** Trolling, insults, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.
        5. **No NSFW/NSFL Content:** Posting explicit NSFW/NSFL content will result in immediate blacklist.
        6. **Respect Sensitive Topics:** Do not trivialize self-harm, suicide, violence, or other offensive topics.
        7. **Report Concerns:** If you observe a violation of these rules, report it to the appropriate hub moderator or InterChat staff for further action.

        To keep things organized, it's recommended to use a separate channel for just for this hub. But don't worry, you can always change this later.

        **How it works:** The InterChat Network is like a magic bridge that links channels on different servers that are with us in this hub. Learn more at our [guide](https://discord-interchat.github.io/docs).
